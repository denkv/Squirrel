/**
 * A Frontier is a central class of the crawler managing a queue of URIs that
 * should be crawled in the future. This includes to give access to the queue in
 * terms of 1) getting the next URIs to crawl and 2) adding new URIs to the
 * queue. Note that the Frontier has the ability to check whether a URI should
 * be crawled and, thus, should be added to the queue or not. For example, a
 * Frontier might not add a URI that has already been crawled.
